# LRU Cache Implementation Exercise

This repository contains a simple implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache in C++ using a doubly linked list and an unordered map. The purpose of this exercise is to deepen understanding of data structures and algorithms, particularly in caching strategies.

## Motivation

In preparation for an upcoming project, I explored LRU caching to optimize data retrieval based on usage patterns, crucial for performance in applications dealing with large datasets.

## Features

- Doubly linked list for maintaining element order.
- Unordered map for fast element access by keys.
- Implemented insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.
- Explored cache size limits and replacement policies.

## Usage

To use the LRU cache implementation:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C++ code (`g++ -o lru Lru.cpp`).
3. Run the executable (`./lru`) for sample operations.
